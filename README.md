# Emotion-Recognition-Through-Speech
This is a POC developed for an intercollege hackathon. Kudos to these guys [Caption] (http://emodb.bilderbar.info/index-1280.html) for providing datasets specifically for the purpose of emotion recognition through speech. Although, the dataset size was small, it was enough to test out some of our hypothesis. The same code was also published as a chapter in the book, "Machine learning and IoT : A biological perspective" [Caption] (https://www.routledge.com/Machine-Learning-and-IoT-A-Biological-Perspective/Sen-Datta-Mitra/p/book/9781138492691) which deals with identifying and exploiting paralinguistic features in human speech signals to detect the emotions of the speaker. The chapter explores various methods, their drawbacks, and provides a comprehensive list of HCI applications of such a system.
