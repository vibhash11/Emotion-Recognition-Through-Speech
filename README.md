# Emotion-Recognition-Through-Speech
Developed this for an hackathon (which my team and I won! :-) ).  Unfortunately, there is lack of available databases specifically for the purpose of emotion recognition ( Although kudos to these guys - http://emodb.bilderbar.info/index-1280.html) . However, our motive was to test out some of our hypothesis rather than to solve a problem. Will try to get back to this problem, once I am more experienced or when I somehow get more data.
